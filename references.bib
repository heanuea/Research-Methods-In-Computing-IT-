@article{9503739920140321,
Abstract = {A software project called DeepFace is nearly as accurate at recognizing human faces as people are, researchers at Facebook AI Group said in a recent paper. DeepFace is 97.25% accurate at matching two faces in lab tests vs. 97.53% for humans. It uses an advanced deep learning neural network software package to sort through databases and learn as it goes. It's not clear what Facebook plans to do with DeepFace, but it could track a user across sites to provide personalized feedback and ads. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},
