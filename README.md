# Research-Methods-In-Computing-IT-

## **_Course Project_**
Produce a Literature review on area of active research 

Requirements 
- Fully referenced 
- IEEE Computing Journal Format 
- Well Written
- IEE/Harvard Referencing Style 
- Meaning Full conclusion - GitHub

## **_Topic of research_**
For my Project i have decided to pick [Facial recognition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facial_recognition_system) as my topic.

## **_Latex_**

We need to write our report in [Latex](https://www.sharelatex.com/project).
LaTeX is a high-quality typesetting system; it includes features designed for 
the production of technical and scientific documentation. LaTeX is the de facto
standard for the communication and publication of scientific documents. 

## **_Approach_**

- I will be reading up on my topic and be sticking up all me findings up here on Github. 
- Firstly i will set up a Wiki on my github where i will set my chapers and sections of the paper 
you can find the link to my wiki here if you click on Wiki.
- I will be studying Latex in class and as i go.
- All references will be documented.
- Proof read.
